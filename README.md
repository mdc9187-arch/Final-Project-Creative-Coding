Notes:

-encountered issue where level 1 challenge easily solved by trapping in the corner. solution will be to allow the orb to travel to opposite sides when moving off screen

-UI level progress bubbles should stay filled showing cumulative level progress



Notes from 12/10 prototype presentation feedback:

-Add sound effects

-Consider color and ways to add character to the orb

-Shading effects for 3d orb

-Possible level or mechanic additon: orb is clicked and splits into two
